# Charlie Berard - README

This document is intended to give you insight into who I am and how I work. Whether you are new, or I am, it is imperative that we know how to work with each other, because we have a lot of work to do. It was inspired by Michael Lopp's [How to Rands](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-rands/), [and](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LGL7fh5zWx8XqHRBra51LcMIHCUluqrdXZ_-XBTXqlg/edit#slide=id.g2703004c10_0_232) [others](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1df5MALZKZU6lOeIXUiO-h6ReFM3KuIpnapSE97IZnX4/edit#slide=id.g2cf5bbf228_0_280). It is very much a work in progress.

## My Responsibility To You

It is my responsibility to provide you with the context necessary to do your job. This means providing you with answers to the following questions:

- What should we be working on?
- Why are we working on it?
- How should we prioritize?

In addition to answering these questions, I am here to remove roadblocks and help you achieve your career goals. If there is more that you need from me, you would be doing me a tremendous favor by letting me know.

## My Values

- **Empathy**: for both customers and coworkers
- **Candor**: speaking honestly and directly to each other is how we get better as a team
- **Curiosity**: we should constantly be testing our assumptions, and seeking out methods of incremental improvement
- **Critical Thinking**: constraints are helpful, assumptions less so

## Feedback

I love feedback. I believe there are [3 key elements](https://medium.com/@royrapoport/why-wont-you-talk-to-me-f30a01a1994c) to giving and receiving feedback:

- **Safety**: you should feel safe giving and receiving candid feedback
- **Effort**: neither of us should be defensive when receiving feedback
- **Benefit**: feedback should have tangible impact

## One-on-One's

We'll have a 30 minute weekly one-on-one. This is your time. It is **not** about providing a status update. This is your time to talk about what's on your mind, what you need, and your career goals. It is also a great time for us to provide each other feedback. Ideally, you'll have a topic or two in mind beforehand for us to discuss. If applicable, I'll also have "skip level" one-on-one's with your reports periodically.

One-on-one's will be in person whenever possible, or via video chat otherwise.

## Meetings

A good meeting should have the following:

- the right people
- a decision maker
- an agenda

A good meeting starts on time, ends with a clear course of action, and never has to occur again.

## My Triggers

Being mean.

Stating opinion as fact.

Wasting time.

## Miscellany

**I’m an introvert**. Prolonged exposure to large groups is exhausting for me. I love 1:1’s and small groups of 3-8. In larger groups I tend to mostly listen and observe.

**I’m excitable**. I can get worked up about things, both good and bad. I’ll start pacing, talking fast, with lots of gestures, and a few expletives. I’m working on this.

**I have a coffee problem**. This may or may not be related to the previous point.
